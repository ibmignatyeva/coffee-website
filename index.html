      <h2>I Love Coffee</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The history of coffee dates back to centuries of old oral tradition in
        modern day Ethiopia, however neither where coffee was first cultivated
        nor direct evidence of its consumption prior to the 15th century have
        been found. Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to
        concentration during prayers.[1] Coffee later spread to the Levant and
        Persia in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether
        it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. Coffee arrived in Italy the
        second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade
        routes, while Central and Eastern Europeans learnt of coffee from the
        Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East
        Indies.
